# The external world exists

[Clear and distinct perceptions are reliably true](./reliable-truth.md), and
[I clearly and distinctly perceive an external world](./perception-of-world.md) —
a world of extended, figured, moving bodies that is the source of my sensory
experience. Since my faculty of clear perception is guaranteed by a
non-deceiving God, the external world as I perceive it must genuinely exist.
