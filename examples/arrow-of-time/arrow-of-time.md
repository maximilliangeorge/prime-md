# The arrow of time emerges from thermodynamic irreversibility

The directionality ("arrow") of time observed in macroscopic phenomena is a consequence of thermodynamic irreversibility, which arises statistically even though the underlying laws are time-symmetric. Irreversible processes (net entropy increase) unfold forward in time, giving rise to an emergent temporal direction at the macroscopic scale.
