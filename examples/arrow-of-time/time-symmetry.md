# Many fundamental physical laws are symmetric with respect to time

Most laws of physics—including Newtonian mechanics, Maxwell’s equations, and the Schrödinger equation—are invariant under time reversal, meaning they have no intrinsic temporal directionality.

However, this time-symmetry does not account for observable macroscopic irreversibility, which arises from statistical and thermodynamic considerations.
