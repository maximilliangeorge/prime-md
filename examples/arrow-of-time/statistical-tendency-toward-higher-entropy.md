# The most probable macrostates are those with the greatest number of microstates

In systems with very large numbers of particles, the probability of the system being found in a particular macrostate is proportional to the number of microstates (W) that correspond to that macrostate. Thus, the system overwhelmingly tends to evolve toward macrostates with greater W — i.e., higher entropy — simply because there are vastly more ways to be disordered than ordered.
