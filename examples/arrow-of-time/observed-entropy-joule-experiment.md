# Example: Joule’s paddle wheel experiment supports the second law

In James Joule’s 19th-century experiment, mechanical energy stirred an insulated liquid, increasing its temperature and entropy. No spontaneous decrease in temperature was ever observed; the entropy of the insulated system (liquid + vessel) only increased, supporting universal observation of the second law of thermodynamics.
