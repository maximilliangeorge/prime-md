# Law of large numbers and statistical dominance

When considering systems with a vast number of particles (such as a gas), the probability that the system is in a macrostate with a large number of corresponding microstates becomes overwhelming. While exceptions (e.g., all gas molecules spontaneously gathering in one corner) are theoretically possible, they are so improbable that they are never observed in practice. The law of large numbers ensures the statistical trend toward higher entropy.
