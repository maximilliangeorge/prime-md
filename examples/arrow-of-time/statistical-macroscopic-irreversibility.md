# Microscopic laws are reversible, but macroscopic irreversibility emerges from probabilistic behavior of large numbers

While the equations of motion for individual particles are time-reversal symmetric, large systems of many particles overwhelmingly tend to evolve toward more probable (higher entropy) states, since there are so many more of them. Improbable entropy-decreasing fluctuations are possible but vanishingly unlikely.
