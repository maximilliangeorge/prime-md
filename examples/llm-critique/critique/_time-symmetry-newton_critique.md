# Critique: Time Reversal Invariance in Newtonian Mechanics

## Argument Reconstruction

**Claim (asserted as axiom):** Newton's laws of motion are unchanged under the substitution t -> -t (with velocity reversal), and therefore the equations permit physically possible solutions in both temporal directions.

This is presented as a single axiom node, but it actually contains two distinct assertions:

1. **Mathematical claim:** Newton's laws are invariant under time reversal (t -> -t, v -> -v).
2. **Physical-interpretive claim:** This invariance means the equations allow for physically possible solutions in either direction of time.

## Assessment as an Axiom

The mathematical claim (1) is **largely correct but requires qualification**. The physical-interpretive claim (2) **does not follow from (1) without substantial hidden premises**, which means this node is doing inferential work while being labeled an axiom.

### The Mathematical Claim

Newton's second law, F = ma, involves the second derivative of position with respect to time. Since d^2x/dt^2 is invariant under t -> -t (two sign flips cancel), the law is indeed time-reversal invariant **provided the force F depends only on positions and is velocity-independent**.

This holds for:
- Gravitational forces
- Electrostatic forces
- Spring forces (Hooke's law)

This **fails** for:
- Frictional forces (F = -bv changes sign under time reversal)
- Magnetic Lorentz forces (F = qv x B, though this is restored if B is also reversed, which is physically appropriate since B is generated by currents)
- Any velocity-dependent dissipative force

**Verdict on (1):** Not unconditionally true. It is true for a restricted class of Newtonian systems -- conservative forces derivable from a potential V(x). The node states this without qualification, which is a significant omission.

### The Physical-Interpretive Claim

The move from "the equations are invariant" to "solutions in either direction are physically possible" contains several hidden assumptions and a potential equivocation on "physically possible."

**Hidden assumptions:**

1. **That mathematical admissibility equals physical possibility.** The equations of motion admitting a time-reversed solution does not entail that the solution is physically realizable. A ball rolling uphill and decelerating is the time-reverse of a ball rolling downhill and accelerating -- both are solutions, but their physical realizability depends on initial/boundary conditions that are not part of the dynamical law itself.

2. **That the argument is silent on the second law of thermodynamics.** Even in a purely Newtonian framework, time-reversal invariance of the microscopic laws coexists with macroscopic irreversibility (the entropy problem). The node's phrasing -- "physically possible solutions in either direction of time" -- risks conflating micro-level time-reversal symmetry with macro-level temporal symmetry, which is precisely what statistical mechanics shows to be unjustified.

3. **That "direction of time" is unambiguous.** The substitution t -> -t is a mathematical operation on the equations. Whether this corresponds to a genuine physical reversal of temporal direction is a substantive metaphysical question (debated by Price, Albert, Maudlin, and others) that the node treats as transparent.

## Fallacy Check

- **Equivocation:** The term "physically possible" is used without disambiguation. It could mean (a) permitted by the dynamical equations, (b) consistent with thermodynamics and boundary conditions, or (c) metaphysically possible given the nature of time. Only reading (a) is straightforwardly supported.
- **Suppressed qualification:** The restriction to conservative forces is not stated, making the mathematical claim overbroad as written.

## Overall Verdict

**Acceptability as axiom:** **Partially acceptable, with reservations.**

The mathematical core -- that Newton's laws for conservative systems are T-symmetric -- is well-established physics and could reasonably serve as an axiom (a starting point not argued for here). However, the node bundles this with an interpretive gloss ("this means...physically possible solutions in either direction") that is inferential, not axiomatic.

**Inferential Strength:** The inference from time-reversal invariance of equations to physical possibility of time-reversed solutions is **inductively weak to moderate** without further premises about what counts as physical possibility and which forces are in scope.

## Key Vulnerabilities

1. The unrestricted claim about Newton's laws fails for any system with friction or dissipative forces, which are ubiquitous in classical mechanics.
2. The inference from mathematical symmetry of equations to physical possibility of reversed solutions is a non-trivial philosophical move that requires justification, not mere assertion.
3. The node is silent on the relationship between microscopic T-symmetry and macroscopic irreversibility (Loschmidt's paradox), which is the central difficulty for any argument that leans on time-reversal invariance.
4. If this axiom is intended to support a downstream argument about the directionality of time, the equivocation on "physically possible" could propagate unsoundness through the entire argument chain.

## Suggestions for Strengthening

1. **Split the node** into a genuinely axiomatic mathematical claim and a separate derived node for the physical interpretation.
2. **Add the qualification** that time-reversal invariance holds for Newtonian systems with conservative (velocity-independent) forces.
3. **Define "physically possible"** explicitly -- does it mean dynamically permitted, thermodynamically permitted, or something else?
4. **Acknowledge the scope limitation:** Even granting T-symmetry of the fundamental laws, this alone does not establish that time-reversed processes are physically possible in the thermodynamic or observational sense. State explicitly whether the claim is restricted to the micro-level.
