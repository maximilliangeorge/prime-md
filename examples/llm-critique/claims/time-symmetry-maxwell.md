# Maxwell’s equations are invariant under time reversal

The equations of classical electromagnetism (Maxwell’s equations) are symmetric under time reversal, provided that the electric and magnetic fields and currents are appropriately transformed. This means that the equations do not themselves prefer a forward or backward direction of time.
