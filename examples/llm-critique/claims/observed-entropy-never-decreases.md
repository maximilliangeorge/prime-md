# Every experimental measurement of an isolated system shows no decrease in total entropy

Across physics, every repeatable experiment involving an isolated system (e.g. closed boxes, insulated containers) has observed that the entropy (a measure of disorder or microstate count) never decreases over time. There are no well-documented exceptions to this empirical regularity; all appear to confirm the second law of thermodynamics.
