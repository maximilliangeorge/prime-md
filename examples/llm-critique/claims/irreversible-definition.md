# A process is thermodynamically irreversible if it cannot be undone without net increase in entropy

A thermodynamic process is called irreversible if it is impossible to return both the system and its environment to their exact initial states without a net increase in entropy elsewhere. Classic examples include spontaneous heat flow from hot to cold, and gases mixing.
