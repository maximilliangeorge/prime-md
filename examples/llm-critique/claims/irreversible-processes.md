# There exist processes which are thermodynamically irreversible

A process is irreversible if, during its occurrence, the entropy of the system (and surroundings, for practical, non-strictly isolated systems) increases. Many natural phenomena—such as heat flow from hot to cold, gas diffusion, or mixing—are irreversible because they lead to a net increase in entropy, which cannot be undone without further increasing entropy elsewhere.
