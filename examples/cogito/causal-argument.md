# The idea of a perfect being requires a cause with infinite reality

[I possess an idea whose objective content is infinite perfection](./idea-of-perfection.md).
By the [principle of causal adequacy](./causal-adequacy.md), the cause of this
idea must contain at least as much formal reality as the idea contains
objectively. A finite mind cannot be the adequate cause of an idea of infinite
perfection. Therefore, something with infinite reality must exist as the
cause of this idea.
