# Clear and distinct perceptions are irresistible

When the mind perceives something clearly (with full cognitive presence) and
distinctly (sharply delineated from all other ideas), it cannot withhold assent.
The perception compels belief in the moment of attending to it. This
irresistibility is a psychological fact about rational minds.
