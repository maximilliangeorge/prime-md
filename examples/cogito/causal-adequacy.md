# A cause must contain at least as much reality as its effect

Nothing comes from nothing. Whatever reality or perfection is found in an
effect must have been present — either formally or eminently — in its cause.
A stone, which did not previously exist, cannot begin to exist unless produced
by something that contains everything found in the stone. An idea's objective
reality likewise demands a cause with at least that degree of formal reality.
