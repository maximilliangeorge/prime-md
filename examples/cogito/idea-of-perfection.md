# I possess an idea of a supremely perfect being

Among my ideas is one of a being that has all perfections — omniscience,
omnipotence, supreme goodness, and every other positive attribute carried to
infinity. Whether or not such a being exists, the idea itself is undeniably
present in my mind as an object of thought.
