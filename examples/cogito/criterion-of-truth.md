# Clear and distinct perception can serve as a criterion of truth

The cogito reveals a model case: [I exist](./cogito.md) is known with absolute
certainty, and what makes it certain is precisely that it is perceived clearly
and distinctly. Since [clear and distinct perceptions compel assent
irresistibly](./clarity.md), and the paradigm case of certainty (the cogito)
is itself a clear and distinct perception, we may provisionally adopt clarity
and distinctness as the mark of truth.
