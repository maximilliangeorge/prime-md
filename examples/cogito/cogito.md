# I exist as a thinking thing

If [thinking is occurring](./thinking.md), and
[thinking requires a thinker](./thinker.md), then a thinker exists. Could a
deceiver make me wrong about this? No — because
[doubt is itself thought](./doubt-is-thought.md), so the very act of being
deceived confirms that I, the one being deceived, am thinking and therefore
exist. *Cogito, ergo sum.*
