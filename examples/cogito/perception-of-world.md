# I clearly and distinctly perceive an external world

I have vivid, involuntary sensory experiences — of extension, figure, motion,
and resistance — that present themselves as originating outside my mind. These
perceptions are clear (fully present to attention) and distinct (not confused
with any other idea). I perceive with maximal clarity that corporeal objects
exist as the source of these experiences.
