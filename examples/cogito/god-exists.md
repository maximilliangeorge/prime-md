# God exists

I [clearly and distinctly perceive](./criterion-of-truth.md) the force of the
[causal argument](./causal-argument.md): my idea of infinite perfection demands
a cause with infinite reality, and only a supremely perfect being — God —
satisfies this requirement. Since clear and distinct perception is the criterion
of truth, and I clearly and distinctly perceive that such a being must exist,
I am justified in concluding that God exists.
