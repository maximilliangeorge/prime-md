# Clear and distinct perceptions are reliably true

The [criterion of truth](./criterion-of-truth.md) — clear and distinct
perception — was initially only provisional: perhaps a deceiver could make
even irresistible perceptions false. But now we know that
[God is no deceiver](./god-is-no-deceiver.md). A non-deceiving God would not
endow me with a faculty that systematically misleads. Therefore, what I
clearly and distinctly perceive is not merely irresistible but genuinely true.
