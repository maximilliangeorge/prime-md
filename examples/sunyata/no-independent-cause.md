# No cause is itself independent of further conditions

If a cause were truly independent — possessing its causal power from its own
side — it would need no further conditions to produce its effect. But every
cause we examine turns out to depend on its own prior causes and concurrent
conditions. A seed depends on soil, water, and warmth; those in turn depend on
further conditions. The regress never terminates in a self-sufficient originator.
