# Nothing is produced from itself or from an independent other

If [all phenomena arise dependently](./dependent-origination.md), and
[no cause is itself independent](./no-independent-cause.md), then nothing in
the causal chain possesses the self-sufficient power to generate anything on its
own. Production is not from self (that would be redundant — the thing already
exists), nor from a truly independent other (no such independent entity is
found), nor from both, nor causelessly. As Nāgārjuna argues in MMK I.1: "Not
from itself, not from another, not from both, not without cause — never in any
way is there any existing thing that has arisen."
