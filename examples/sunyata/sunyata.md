# Śūnyatā: the Middle Way between eternalism and nihilism

[All phenomena are empty of intrinsic nature](./emptiness-of-phenomena.md), yet
[this emptiness is not nihilism](./emptiness-not-nihilism.md) — it is the very
condition that makes dependent origination, change, and conventional truth
possible. And [emptiness itself is empty](./emptiness-of-emptiness.md), so it
cannot be grasped as a new metaphysical foundation.

This is *Śūnyatā* as articulated by Nāgārjuna's Mādhyamaka: a middle way
(*madhyamā pratipad*) that avoids both eternalism (things have fixed essences)
and nihilism (nothing exists at all). What remains is the open, groundless play
of dependently originated appearances — neither ultimately real nor utterly
non-existent, but conventionally valid precisely because they are empty.
