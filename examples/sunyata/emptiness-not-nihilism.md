# Emptiness is not nihilism but the ground of conventional existence

If [all phenomena are empty](./emptiness-of-phenomena.md), one might conclude
that nothing exists at all. But emptiness is entailed by — and equivalent to —
[dependent origination](./dependent-origination.md). It is *because* things
lack inherent existence that they can arise, change, and cease in dependence on
conditions. If things had svabhāva, change and causal interaction would be
impossible. Nāgārjuna writes (MMK XXIV.14): "For whom emptiness is possible,
everything is possible; for whom emptiness is not possible, nothing is
possible." Śūnyatā thus underwrites rather than undermines the conventional
world.
