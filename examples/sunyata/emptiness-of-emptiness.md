# Emptiness itself is empty

[All phenomena are empty](./emptiness-of-phenomena.md). But emptiness is
itself a relational concept — it is always *emptiness of* something — and
[relations cannot be established independently of their
terms](./relation-requires-terms.md). Emptiness is not a hidden substance or
ultimate ground; it too lacks svabhāva. To reify emptiness into an absolute
would be to fall into the very essentialism the analysis dismantles. As
Nāgārjuna warns (MMK XIII.8): "The Victorious Ones have said that emptiness is
the relinquishing of all views. For whomever emptiness is a view, that one has
accomplished nothing."
