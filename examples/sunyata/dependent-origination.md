# All phenomena arise dependently

No dharma (phenomenon) arises from itself, from something wholly other, from
both, or from no cause at all. Every phenomenon comes into being only in
dependence on causes and conditions (*pratītyasamutpāda*). The Buddha declares
in the *Majjhima Nikāya*: "When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising
of this, that arises." This is taken as a foundational observation, confirmed
both by contemplative analysis and by ordinary experience of the natural world.
