# No phenomenon possesses intrinsic nature

Since [nothing is produced from itself or from an independent
other](./nothing-self-caused.md), no phenomenon has an origin that is
self-sufficient. But [intrinsic nature would require precisely such
independence](./identity-requires-essence.md) — to have svabhāva is to exist
without depending on causes, parts, or imputation. Because every phenomenon is
dependently originated, none can possess svabhāva. What appears to be a
thing's "own nature" is only a conventional designation applied to a nexus of
conditions.
