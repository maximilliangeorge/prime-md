# Intrinsic nature would mean existing independently

To possess *svabhāva* (intrinsic nature, own-being) is to have an identity that
does not depend on anything else — not on causes, not on parts, not on
conceptual imputation. If something had svabhāva, it would be self-identical in
all contexts, unchanging, and ontologically self-sufficient. This is the
Ābhidharmika and common-sense notion of what it would mean for something to
*truly* or *inherently* exist.
