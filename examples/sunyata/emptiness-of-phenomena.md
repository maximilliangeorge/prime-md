# All phenomena are empty of intrinsic nature

[No phenomenon possesses svabhāva](./no-svabhava.md), and this is confirmed by
[the observable fact that all phenomena change](./change-is-observed.md). If
anything had intrinsic nature it would be immune to change, since its identity
would not depend on conditions. But nothing is immune to change. Therefore every
phenomenon — physical and mental, conditioned and unconditioned, saṃsāric and
nirvāṇic — is *śūnya*, empty of inherent existence. This is the central
thesis of Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*.
