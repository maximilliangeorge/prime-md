# Phenomena observably change

Everything encountered in experience is impermanent (*anicca*). Compounded
things arise, persist for a time, and cease. The body ages, mental states
fluctuate moment to moment, seasons turn, stars ignite and collapse. No
phenomenon has been found that remains utterly static across all conditions.
This is confirmed by direct observation and is one of the three marks of
existence (*tilakkhaṇa*) taught by the Buddha.
