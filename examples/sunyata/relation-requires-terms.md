# Relations require relata, and relata require relations

A relation cannot exist without the terms it relates, and the terms cannot be
identified except through their relations. "Left" has no meaning without
"right"; "cause" has no meaning without "effect." Neither the relation nor the
relata can be established first — they arise only mutually, each empty of
independent existence. Nāgārjuna deploys this structure repeatedly in the
*Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* to show that no term in a relational pair is
self-grounding.
